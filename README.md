KiCad is an open-source software suite for designing electronic schematics and printed circuit boards (PCBs). It includes tools for schematic capture, PCB layout, component library management, and 3D visualization. KiCad works completely offline, making it ideal for engineers and hobbyists to create and edit designs without internet access.
